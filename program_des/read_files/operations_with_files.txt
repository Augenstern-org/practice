Files: like a book that must be open
 open gets the name (or the path)
      of the file as a string
      returns a 'file' object.
      
      Open default operation is READ.
      open(filename, 'r') opens in READ mode
      open(filename, 'w') opens in WRITE mode
      open(filename, 'a') opens in APPEND mode
          (it will not overwrite the previous content)
      
      Remember that a file MUST be closed.
      Better TO use the with statement
      with open(filename) as file:
        # REMEMBER this opens a new
        # block of instructions!!
        
      
      
        
     

Reading files-> returns string 
- file.read()   no options
     the whole file is read in one singl operation

- file.read (n)  with a number
     just n bytes (characters) are read

- file.readline() no options
     returns a string reading up to the first \n character

- file.readlines() no options
     returns a list with each line as a string

- the for statement: for line in file
     begins a new block of instructions to be
     repeated for every line of the file

Moving in an open file:
- seek (n)  with a number
     moves the pointer within the content of
     the open file


Writing into a file
- file.write(string)    writes string into the file
                        (without any added character)
- file.writelines(alist) writes all the strings in list
                         into the file
                         (without any added character)
