Lists are modifiable.
Lists can be summed -> concatenation.
Lists can be multiplied by integers
    (repeated concatenation)
We can access a single element with the [] operator.
We can slice lists with the [] operator.
 Slice means to select only part of the list.
 s[i:j] returns a list with the elements
        between pos. i and j (excluded)
 s[i:j:step] returns a list wth the elements
             beteween pos. i and j (excluded)
             jumping by step
             
Methods for lists.
.append(obj)     add a new element at the  end
                 of the list

                 position  of the list
.extend(alist)   appends all the elements of
                 alist to the end of the list
.remove(obj)     removes obj from the list
                 no return (it can generate error)
.pop() (no param) remove and returns the last
                 element of the list
.pop(n) (n is int) remove and returns the 
                 element in position i of the list                 
.sort()          sorts the list in ascending order
.sort(reverse=True) sorts the list in 
                     descending order
